HERMES Shell - Synopsis
===================================

hermes-shell is a command line interface program for managing HERMES services upon a local machine.  It is used either by system administrators managing HERMES servers or by developers working upon the HERMES eco-system.

Once a machine is `setup <https://github.com/Prodiguer/hermes-shell/blob/master/docs/os-setup.rst>`_ so that HERMES services can be run upon it `installation <https://github.com/Prodiguer/hermes-shell/blob/master/docs/installation.rst>`_ of the hermes-shell is simple and furthermore isolated from the host machine.

Once installed a wide set of HERMES related `commands <https://github.com/Prodiguer/hermes-shell/blob/master/docs/usage.rst>`_ can be invoked from the command line (supported commands are prefixed by **hermes-**).  The user, either a system administrator or developer, will invoke commands in order to streamline interactions with the HERMES eco-system.
