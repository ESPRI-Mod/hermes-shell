Prodiguer Shell - Configuration
===================================

Once the prodiguer-shell has been `installed <https://github.com/Prodiguer/prodiguer-shell/blob/master/docs/installation.rst>`_ configuration is acheived by setting `environment variables <https://github.com/Prodiguer/prodiguer-shell/blob/master/docs/environment-variables.rst>`_.

The environment variable definition file is $HOME/.prodiguer.  You can edit this file with a text editor in order to update configuration.

The environment variable values are then pushed into the main prodiguer.json configuration file which is found at $HOME/ops/config/prodiguer.json.

Normally you will not need to edit the prodiguer.json file although system administrators may wish to do so in order to fine-tune configuration.
